# Zombiecalypse 
There's been a zombie outbreak around the world, a few humans have survived, and you are not one of them.
The purpose of the game is to eat all the brains as possible before they reach the ground.
The game screen is an interface from which brains will fall.
The player is represented by a zombie sprite, that has to reach the "good" brains, and avoid the bad ones.
The movement is horizontal and vertical, control keys it will be up, right and left. The player will be able to jump to catch/avoid objects.
The game ends if the zombie has a crash with one of the cars trying to kill it.
